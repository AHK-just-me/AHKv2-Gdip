# AHKv2-Gdip
Gdip_All library compatiable with [AHK v2](https://autohotkey.com/v2/).

This is a preliminary version, and it is not backwards compatible with AHK v1. There are syntax changes and changed command names. The file works and can be run by the v2 interpreter without errors. I also gave it a look with my eyes for anything I thought needed changing. I may have missed some things. 

It has not been tested thorougly. Please submit feedback
