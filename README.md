# AHKv2-Gdip
This repository contains the GDI+ library (Gdip_All.ahk) backwards compatiable with both AHK v1.1 and [AHK v2](https://autohotkey.com/v2/).  
Support for AHK v1.0 has been dropped (find the original `Gdip_All.ahk` library if you need that).  

See the [commit history](https://github.com/mmikeww/AHKv2-Gdip/commits/master) to see the changes made. There is probably lots of room for improvement still.  

It has not been tested thorougly on AHK v2, but all of the tutorial files in the `/Examples/` subfolder work successfully.
